# Lauren C
Hello!

I am looking to bring my enduring interest in knowledge accessibility to a technical writing career.

I have been a software developer and engineering manager and technical writing has been a part of each of these roles.

I have degrees in computer science and anthropology and am always looking into what I can learn next.

In my off time I am a powerlifter, crafter, and reader.
