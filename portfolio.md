## WooCommerce Subscriptions

WooCommerce Subscriptions is a complex, popular extension used with WooCommerce and WordPress to allow a site to sell on a subscription model. This software is used by store managers to run their store, as well as their customers to buy from the store. The documentation I worked on is for end-users and developers.

Within the Subscriptions documentation I was working within the guidelines of the broader WooCommerce ecosystem. The process included software research, drafting, review, collaboration, and publishing.

### Subscriptions Early Renewal Guide

The process in generating this document included exploring the software to understand the feature and acquire screenshots, consulting with developers, and observing the conventions of the wider WooCommerce documentation ecosystem.

### Subscriptions and the GDPR

This document is both for users to understand more about how this software deals with their data and for store managers to learn how to use the offered tools for GDPR compliance. This included learning about how the wider WordPress ecosystems handles GDPR compliance and elaborating on how the subscriptions software builds on that system.
