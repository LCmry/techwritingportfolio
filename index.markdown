<h3 style="text-align: center;">An enduring interest in knowledge accessibility.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">
I love learning and gaining insights from every new piece of knowledge. From the power of observation and breaking down mental models with anthropology to the rigor and consistency needed when writing code, I have learned much from my previous degrees and experiences. And I canâ€™t wait to learn more.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
I have been a software developer and engineering manager and technical writing has been part of both of those roles. I bring experience with the development lifecycle and the technical details of code as well as the collaboration and communication skills needed to work in a team environment.
